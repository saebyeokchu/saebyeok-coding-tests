# 🌅 Saebyeok Coding Tests

A curated collection of coding test solutions and algorithm exercises — written to prepare for technical interviews, enhance problem-solving skills, and document personal progress.

> Built with clarity, efficiency, and clean code principles in mind.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- ✅ Technical interview preparation (e.g., Samsung, Kakao, Naver, etc.)
- ✅ Regular algorithm practice using TypeScript and other languages
- ✅ Personal reference library for solving common coding problems
- ✅ Efficient and readable solution patterns

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Mostly TypeScript and Python (with occasional Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Style**: Modular functions + readable comments for explanation
- **Tools**: Jest (optional) for testing

## 📁 Structure

```bash
platform-problemnumber.ext # Each File Represent Problems
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Node.js & dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run a specific test or file

```bash
ts-node programmers/level2/target-sum.ts
```

Or if you use `jest` for testing:
